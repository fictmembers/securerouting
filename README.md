#                       UNIQUE PATH FINDER                          
## Developed for routing security in computers network.

Program finds unique routes in non-oriented network (graph).
It uses tree different ways to find unique ways:
 - Modified Bellman-Fords algorithm
 - Ants algorithm
 - Custom wave algorithm

There are two variants of tasks:
 - to find as much way as we can without looking on their costs
 - to find set of unique paths that have lowest costs
First two algorithm are solving first described task, and third algorithm is
trying to solve second problem.
