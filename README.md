#                       UNIQUE PATHFINDER PROGRAM                          
## Developed to improve routing security in computers network.

Finds unique routes in non-oriented graph.
It uses tree different ways to find unique ways:
 - Modified Bellman-Fords algorithm
 - Ants algorithm
 - Custom wave algorithm

There are two variants of tasks:
 - to find as much way as we can without looking on their costs
 - to find set of unique paths whith have lowest cost
First two algorithm solve first described task, and third algorith is
trying to solve second problem.
